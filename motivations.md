* My Career Motivations:

  My motivations stem from a combination of feeling boxed into a travel heavy career and being worn out with the engineering world.

1. Travel heavy career
  Control systems is a world where in most companies the application/project engineer will carry a project from conception to installation. Most installations depending on the company/product can mean weeks to months on site. After 7 years of traveling for work, enough is enough. I would like to have a work life balance, where I can know my vacations will happen when I want, I don't miss holidays and birthdays, and I can be home for dinner every night.

1. Engineering world
  Changes are slow. Frankly most engineering companies in my field are more mature/old companies with old ways of doing things. There is not a whole lot of innovation or revolution, just iteration. It gets stale when you want a new challenge. Engineering companies also seem a little behind with the times and can be slow to change culture that is toxic or archaic.
